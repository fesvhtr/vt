1
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,900
And then a shaker.

2
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,800
Time-stamped.

3
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,200
Poke at it.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,266
Poke a little. Poke a little each.

5
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,133
Wrap it around and poke it.

6
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,100
Hey can see

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
(of an unmarried couple) be close

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,933
boot up (computer)

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
That's what we'll be discussing today.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,800
mornings

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Let's talk about what we're gonna do on our last day.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,133
And then maybe

13
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,000
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,733
That's four more of these USBs over here.

15
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,066
It's possible that what's this? What's this?

16
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:10,866
This hard drive.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,066
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,966
In the morning I think the main discussion was

19
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,800
And then there's nothing else to do while the discussion is going on

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,466
If people are in deep thought

21
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,266
It's an embarrassment.

22
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,766
You can give this a go.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,166
Now that's embarrassing.

24
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,466
No, no, no.

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,300
Let's take it apart and see what it is.

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,800
Wow.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Only four?

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
For only four.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
No, it's fine.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,366
You've taken this apart for me, right? I'll do it.

31
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,900
Because you're right.

32
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,066
Haha I've already installed this thing

33
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,933
If you need a rechargeable battery, you can get it here. Thank you.

34
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:02,966
fastener

35
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,000
It's out.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,766
What can we do?

37
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,700
Keep the box.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,566
Well, this thing inside can be thrown away.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,966
this category of ingredients

40
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,133
It hasn't flowed in the last two years.

41
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:24,866
Then 1% first.

42
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,066
This one's for when everyone's in deep thought.

43
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,800
I can tell you about this one.

44
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,166
What is this thing?

45
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,933
In fact, you can look at this place

46
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:39,766
interjection of surprise

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,333
That's you looking at my workshop.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,300
Are we breaking and entering?

49
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:58,766
workplace

50
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:02,600
And there are six computers in this place, right?

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,133
Uh, and then 77.

52
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,766
Eight. - Uh-huh.

53
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,066
Recording will be this computer.

54
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,333
Each computer corresponds to one of your eyes.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,166
One eyeglass.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,133
And then this every computer I have every time you guys uh

57
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:16,933
End of recording.

58
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,900
Every three hours.

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,933
And then it's gonna be, uh-

60
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,366
That's where it's dumped into this hard drive.

61
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,200
And then this hard drive

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,700
It's the hard drive you'll be installing later.

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,133
Let's say it's this.

64
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,566
This L1, this L1.

65
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:28,500
This L2, this

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,000
All the names are written here.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
All right, here's your data in this.

68
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,000
It's our second life.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,066
Haha Second Life is in this one

70
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,933
Uh, let's say I'm an L1, right?

71
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,400
And then when you're done.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,166
That's what's gonna stick this eye up here.

73
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,300
And in the meantime, I've been following this.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,100
The first hard drive.

75
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,533
Yeah, and then this hard drive, it's got two cables.

76
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,300
One for the computer.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,466
One for the power supply.

78
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,333
And then this power supply

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,700
It's for this hard drive to pretend it's on the computer.

80
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,466
So what this box means is that

81
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,500
He gives a simulation of a computer environment

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
cheat sb again

83
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,966
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the hard drive knows it's got to work.

84
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,700
Uh and then this line ah this line

85
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,533
We've had some fun wiring it up.

86
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,600
Growing up like this is a hanging

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,100
What happens if the power goes out suddenly?

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,900
It's not good to say that a sudden computer blackout is going to

89
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,866
There's no such thing as a USB.

90
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,266
It's one of those backup power supplies.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
desirable

92
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,733
Beijing Providence

93
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,066
(express) thanks

94
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,000
we

95
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,133
Can we just talk and pretend?

96
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,533
Yeah, or maybe you guys should bring it first.

97
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,700
What did you bring?

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,400
You brought it.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,266
You'd better put on your glasses.

100
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,200
These glasses.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, it doesn't cover it.

102
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,366
I don't think it's even covered.

103
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,533
It's not covered now.

104
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,333
He's got a hole right here.

105
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,000
And then this place is going to be packed in here

106
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,366
So that's how you want it to be aligned.

107
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,900
Then slowly push it in.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,266
Let's see how it goes.

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,500
It's a little lighter.

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,933
That student told me the other day that it's quite fragile.

111
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,000
How do you do that?

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,333
It's okay.

113
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,900
Isn't there an opening here?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,366
It's the opposite of this one.

115
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,733
You just put them like this against

116
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,333
Then we'll see how it goes.

117
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,800
Push that in your hand.

118
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,966
He's still a little tight here if you put a little pressure on him.

119
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,166
But don't break it if you try too hard.

120
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,400
It's like you're so fragile.

121
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,266
But I don't really know much about this

122
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,766
There's a lot of screws to be screwed.

123
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,766
Yeah, where's the screw?

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,866
In there.

125
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,733
Oh, I see.

126
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:03,733
easy

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,266
And then just put it in.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,333
Uh-huh.

129
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,966
And then we're gonna put it in this box.

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,133
It's just that you'd better take this place off

131
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,200
And then this movie can be discarded.

132
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,933
Because we're going to use it for screws later.

133
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,966
Is it just four screws?

134
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,000
Uh, eight.

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,533
Eight? - Yeah.

136
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,466
yea

137
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:31,166
That's you. You pull out that strip.

138
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,500
Yeah, and then you see that hole?

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,566
The long one.

140
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:35,933
He's got a screw hole in there.

141
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,200
You're gonna have to put that on, too.

142
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,933
That's the screw hole for the big screw.

143
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,133
Ah which one?

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,566
Uh, I've got one screw up here.

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,533
That's it.

146
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,466
This thing.

147
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,800
Well, how about I point you in the right direction?

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Hey, you're on the right track.

149
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:53,733
Uh-huh.

150
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,866
And then every one of them over here.

151
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,966
And then this one too. So that's eight.

152
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:57,933
Yeah, I got it.

153
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,100
See, that's the big screw.

154
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,400
You see this?

155
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,500
For small screws

156
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,133
Come here.

157
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,066
Inside, you just stick it in, right?

158
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,166
Just that, uh, that.

159
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:07,733
right

160
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,566
Well, it's supposed to go in there.

161
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:10,900
Sub-formed circuits or what?

162
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,733
We've been complaining about the magnetism for the last time

163
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,966
But it seems like nobody has anything today.

164
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,466
Everyone seems to be taking it well today.

165
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,466
To what?

166
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,466
The one that comes with it can't give you anything.

167
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,500
It's just that this screwdriver is not magnetic.

168
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,266
Yeah, that's why it's a big deal here.

169
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,500
It's numb when you put the screws in.

170
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,066
That's where it's enlarged.

171
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,600
But the big ones will snap in.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Uh, that's what he looks like.

173
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,066
There's nothing he can do.

174
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,100
Right through this hole.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,800
You just have to fix it like this.

176
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,133
This one? - Yeah.

177
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,766
Or stuff it inside.

178
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:52,000
I stuffed a little lens.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
It should be as long as it takes to hold it in place

180
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,533
Is that right?

181
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:02,666
better

182
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,500
we

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Is it possible to have a little BGM support to

184
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,166
What kind of music do people listen to?

185
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,966
I'm listening to David Tao.

186
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,400
Uh, rm rm rm.

187
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,900
I'm an omega so I'm just listening.

188
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,066
Give everyone a more energized

189
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,100
Look at that Northeast Sister Li's BGM

190
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,733
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

191
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,166
This is the kind of work that must be done with a lot of energy.

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,800
I want to carry it. - Carry it.

193
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,133
(onom.) hahaha

194
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,933
It's just a half-embedded one, isn't it? That's good.

195
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:10,966
OK, my hometown in the Northeast.

196
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,566
I'm Inari.

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,066
No, not that Changchun

198
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,000
Changchun, Jilin Province

199
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,400
Do you know this city?

200
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,100
Did you know there's a Jilin City in Jilin Province?

201
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,333
I'm not in Changchun.

202
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,933
seems like

203
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:46,500
the Great Northeast

204
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,100
Blowing out beautiful patterns

205
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,933
I'll give you two for each song you play together.

206
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,666
Drunken moon warms my heart

207
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:03,166
The Great Northeast is my hometown

208
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,166
Gee, why do humans like to listen to music like that?

209
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,500
Confusing behavior

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
And then there's a screw over here looking at the side

211
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:18,066
It looks like it's okay out here without putting it back in.

212
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,333
I think we threw out this one the other night.

213
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,800
I remember this outfit.

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
You can throw this one away, right?

215
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,333
I managed to put it in yesterday.

216
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, I see. Well, we'll do it that day.

217
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Is that all right?

218
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,066
It's ready to go in.

219
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,333
Yes, I've already been in.

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,866
Ah, you've been there.

221
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,466
I think those wiring ones at our university

222
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,766
Soldering the boards is no different than going in.

223
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:51,566
In particular, electricity

224
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:56,066
Uh, electrician to electrician, weld plate to electrician.

225
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,966
The internship will do some amazing stuff

226
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,166
Our school, too.

227
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,900
You know why we softwares have to learn it too.

228
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,733
Next assembly line

229
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you hooked up to a computer on the next assembly line?

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,900
(onom.) hahaha

231
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,566
The next one needs a senior technician

232
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,766
Hahaha advanced technician pause

233
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,300
noisy

234
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,400
3,000 Jeet Kune Do to 5,000 Jeet Kune Do.

235
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,366
Do you think this is Jeet Kune Do?

236
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,700
What is Jeet Kune Do?

237
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:35,533
skilled worker

238
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,900
skilled worker

239
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,066
Hey why am I

240
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,466
Because you pressed it the other way around.

241
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,133
Ah, hi, hi.

242
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,933
It's over. It's embarrassing.

243
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,066
Chatting away at the bottom of the pile.

244
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,466
Hahaha no I have to fight for it

245
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,600
I can't be at the bottom of the list.

246
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Ha-ha-ha.

247
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:02,933
You're done, and then what?

248
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,100
Don't you have to do anything?

249
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,066
It should be fine after the screwing.

250
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,266
And he's just going to blithely say it's done.

251
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:11,100
And then?

252
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,300
He provoked me.

253
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,666
What the hell are the chances?

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,933
Is that so?

255
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:18,966
I think so.

256
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,566
All right.

257
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,333
You see, you're not pretending to be beautiful.

258
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,533
I don't need to load it.

259
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:27,500
I'll do it with or without the strip.

260
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,100
It's a pain in the ass not to install it.

261
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,166
You can put bars in it.

262
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,266
If it needs to be installed.

263
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:36,466
And then just load it yourself more often haha

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,200
OK

265
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,566
He's ready to go.

266
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,000
Completed a strange first mission

267
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,300
And then this EGO life last day

268
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,866
Who will people invite?

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
final day

270
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,666
The last day is Sunday, right?

271
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,466
Sunday.

272
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,100
Sunday afternoon.

273
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,200
Ah, who will everyone invite?

274
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,300
How many people will be invited?

275
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,200
You guys write on the blackboard.

276
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,366
You can write on the board.

277
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,066
Come on, I've got a very nice handwriting.

278
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,366
We also have a shelf.

279
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:22,500
Why don't we print them too?

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,733
What frame?

281
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,100
Black chalkboard stand yes?

282
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,933
If you think this is hard to write like this

283
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,200
Well, there's actually a

284
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:34,933
No pen.

285
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,900
Let's wait to install it.

286
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,000
Write first. It's not a problem.

287
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,366
It doesn't affect me as a calligrapher.

288
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,300
Where's the pen? Where's the pen?

289
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,666
good question

290
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,300
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

291
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,733
Ask him about AIB.

292
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,166
Looking for my iPhone?

293
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,166
(onom.) hahaha

294
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,066
Looking for my

295
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,266
Looking for my Pansu.

296
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,533
We're all iPhones, aren't we?

297
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,133
Seems like I should be the iPhone.

298
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,400
Oops what kind of crap ah hahaha

299
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Ah, is that a dog?

300
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:26,700
Why didn't I change it?

301
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,300
He's an iPhone. He's Izzy.

302
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,700
Oh, oh, OK.

303
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,266
Hey so our one person in the end which two ah

hahaha ah oh so hey that lol

307
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,133
We're going to start with one or two.

308
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,533
Hey, what about us?

309
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,800
Ah OK yesterday I didn't

310
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,766
I didn't guess yesterday.

311
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:59,533
Though I guessed he might be a skeptic EGO life.

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,866
Last day's list

313
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,666
you

314
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:12,566
hips

315
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,500
That's what it says.

316
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,700
waist of a brush stroke

317
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,666
How do you spell waist?

318
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,533
That's what it says.

319
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,333
classifier for objects in rows such as words

320
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,733
Dumb ass didn't remove the clamps.

321
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,400
Ha ha ha ah

322
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,533
Why didn't you unload it?

323
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Bao Gui Tou Bao Gui Tou

324
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:37,300
Hahaha okay

325
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,366
first place

326
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,733
Let's just say you invite a few people

327
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,933
I'll invite one.

328
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,566
Asa Asa invited one ah

329
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:54,066
I'm not sure because we're so far away.

330
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,200
I don't know if my buddy's gonna make it.

331
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,133
And your studio.

332
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,066
I'll invite one.

333
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Shallow invites one

334
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,533
What's the name?

335
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,533
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

336
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,933
Hahaha this one's not gonna work.

337
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm just gonna put a straight face on it, that's all.

338
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,100
Ah, it's good to have a straight face.

339
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,800
Or you use that little ball.

340
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,900
I guess it's enough to draw a little person.

341
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,266
That's what boys do.

342
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,500
Girls twice.

343
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:26,600
You invited hahaha is this the girl you invited?

344
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Ah you ah then I also invite a girl

345
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,366
This one, this braid.

346
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:40,066
He doesn't have this connector on his head.

347
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,300
Ah this wig my goodness

348
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,466
Ha ha ha ha! Let's go to the sky!

349
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,766
Hey I should invite a boy

350
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,333
Boys.

351
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:06,333
I love the three legs of the heart hahahahaha this fits right in

352
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,466
I'm sorry for drawing my head by accident.

353
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,466
Ha ha ha ha ha OK

354
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,500
I could actually ask a girl

355
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,966
But I'm not sure he'll be able to handle it.

356
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,166
Because he's pretty far away.

357
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:30,266
Hahaha ok doubtful right doubtful

358
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,400
There's more.

359
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,800
I can put a name under each one.

360
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,133
Write a host for him.

361
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:38,900
Host?

362
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,066
Well, your address is your code name.

363
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:41,900
Claim it.

364
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,300
No, no, no.

365
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,533
You'll just write underneath this little man

366
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,866
Or write one on it or on your face or something.

367
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,866
Whose is this?

368
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,366
So, he's stupid. He's stupid.

369
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,766
Hahaha!

370
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,566
This is Woo-hin's.

371
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:10,200
That says LX LYX

372
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,400
(onom.) hahahaha

373
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
Who does this one belong to?

374
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:22,333
I'm Lucy or I'll write an "l".

375
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,733
Ha-ha Lucy.

376
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,066
And you're inviting two, right?

377
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,933
Yeah, but one of them might not make it.

378
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:36,600
Both genders are female huh?

379
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,733
I don't know if I can make it.

380
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,366
Just draw me a star. A pentagram.

381
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,500
OK

382
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,466
Now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, six guests.

383
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,400
Uh, 4-6 guests.

384
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:02,766
right

385
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,066
4-6 guests 4-6 guests OK

386
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,900
hiccup

387
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,300
We were going to do it if we could.

388
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,500
Go and invite the people around you.

389
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,933
Ah yes.

390
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,266
Or a novel.

391
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,466
Is it by knocking on doors and asking questions?

392
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
hiccup

393
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,466
It's better to carry a basket of eggs.

394
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,700
Ha ha ha ha eat shit

395
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:30,700
if if if

396
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,200
that is, if

397
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,566
They can give out eggs if they come.

398
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,300
What sounds like a sausage.

399
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,166
Ha ha ha! Tomorrow our land will be reported.

400
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:42,166
Hahaha we can get a cop shot tomorrow

401
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,000
(onom.) hahaha

402
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,466
2 Invite neighbors

403
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,600
It's hard to write the word "waist

404
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,000
Or you can be crooked.

405
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,466
I think so.

406
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,466
Bring a lanyard.

407
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,333
I'll give you this column if you come.

408
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,800
If you don't come, I won't send you.

409
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,933
haha neighbor (polite address)

410
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:05,366
be at a standstill

411
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
curse it!

412
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,766
Qi Wan Shi was in tears.

413
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,600
It's got a vintage feel to it.

414
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:19,266
This is our plan to question the plan.

415
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,533
So many question marks.

416
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:27,900
We're like the Riddler.

417
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,800
(onom.) hahahaha

418
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,766
the Riddler

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,866
And then we also

420
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,066
And what else?

421
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,533
Uh, this is the personnel section.

422
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,600
Uh, the crew.

423
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,733
There are still five people in the crew.

424
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,300
In total, look.

425
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,200
How many people do we end up holding?

426
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,600
And then look at this activity

427
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,466
What's the point of adding this number?

428
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
filament

429
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,900
Isn't it okay to get technical?

430
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,500
How much trouble did you get into later?

431
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:19,133
Okay, so one, two, three, four.

432
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,566
Four to six four plus five five

433
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:31,000
It's 9+5, 9999 to 11.

434
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,666
9 to 11, then each.

435
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,466
private saving of family members

436
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,100
Count us in, right?

437
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,700
Hey, thanks, too.

438
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,300
9-11 Figure positive infinity

439
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,100
Because we can invite the neighbors

440
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,066
It's very strict, isn't it?

441
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:49,866
right

442
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,566
It's not exactly infinity, is it? 1.6 billion.

443
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:57,766
Hahaha now our country

444
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,533
Our population of 1.6 billion?

445
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,800
1414, right? Then it's 14 and done.

446
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,500
That's half a million dollars for the move.

447
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,900
91 iPhone haha

448
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Does it fit? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

449
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,700
And then the good people identified

450
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,466
This is the first.

451
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:32,200
Three dots below the third of the first big dot.

452
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,733
And then we have a second point.

453
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,533
Shall we start the content part of the program? - Yes.

454
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,100
I think it's a tough nut to crack.

455
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,333
We'll be chewing for a long time.

456
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,200
So we're just gonna start with this?

457
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:52,800
Is there anything else?

458
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,900
(onom.) hahaha

459
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,866
Activities

460
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,100
Think about it.

461
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,066
I think I remember people filling out the questionnaire.

462
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,333
Right? - Yeah.

463
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
What did everyone fill out on the questionnaire?

464
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,300
It's not all GPT-generated, is it?

465
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,133
No. Ha ha ha.

466
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,100
I thought of the GPT generation myself

467
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,200
Well, since we're talking about Hunan GPT.

468
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
So let's start with

469
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,266
LYX, come here.

470
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:27,333
Hahaha I I think that's the one that's uh 7 days

471
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,066
Then buy the flowers for me.

472
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,333
And then a vase each.

473
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,133
Then it's the equivalent of uh, waking up and spending a day or two.

474
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,766
And then it just happens to be a cycle.

475
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,733
It's just that you can let this flower open slowly

476
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,333
Then take the petals of this flower

477
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,933
And then make that embossing.

478
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,400
Then it's more environmentally friendly

479
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,700
Make it one of those postcards.

480
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,700
And got that acrylic glass.

481
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,266
And then it's embedded.

482
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,700
It's the kind of handmade that looks better

483
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
And then it's also about plants.

484
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:52,800
And then the raw materials were carefully raised by themselves for another 7 days

485
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,133
Then again, it felt like forming a mural

486
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,366
Just did some peripheral

487
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,766
We can distribute them on that day.

488
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:00,566
be on top of sb's game

489
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,566
Where's the tweed?

490
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,366
The flowers are still waking up.

491
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:05,966
Because I look at me.

492
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:08,466
I was just thinking about planting one of those things

493
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,733
It's the kind of world that fits the Earth.

494
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,600
The Earth's discovery is basically impossible to germinate in 7 days.

495
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,766
And then I thought about what kind of talent I'd buy for these flowers.

496
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,366
The flowers from Yunnan that were sent directly by HSBC are

497
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:23,600
I think he has two buns.

498
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,600
Yes I bought peony ah really do not want to give away

499
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,200
sound of child's crying

500
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:33,333
I've got some flowers that will open in the next couple of days.

501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,166
You want to find some scissors or something?

502
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,366
Scissors to dry

503
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,166
Or do we have to finish cracking the back?

504
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,333
Uh, do it first. Do it first.

505
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Where are the scissors?

506
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,566
I've bought several bunches.

507
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:50,266
The scissors are here and I bought carnations to write with.

508
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,966
It just so happens that we have more girls.

509
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:02,366
Ah, that too.

510
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,966
The petals can be used for embossing.

511
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:09,466
And then I bought the embosser to see what kind of dryer it was.

512
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,500
What's this?

513
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,533
This is a flower. This one needs to be nurtured.

514
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,766
Is this a peony?

515
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:34,866
Well, I bought more than I realized.

516
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,566
He said it would take a day or two to bloom

517
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:42,466
It takes two or three days to press the flowers.

518
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:43,933
And then this one for two or three days.

519
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:55,766
What kind of lily is this?

520
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:56,900
Vanilla or something.

521
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,566
What lily? - The lily of the valley.

522
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,100
Nutrients soaked in water to speed up the wake-up call.

523
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,800
These two colors of

524
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,566
One white and one yellow.

525
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,400
Is it a package?

526
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,600
I think I remember him sending two packages.

527
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,200
Why don't you see if we can do a talent show?

528
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,733
See which ones are yours.

529
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:34,466
Without me.

530
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Without you.

531
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,866
Put it on the ground first.

532
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:44,966
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

533
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,600
Did you guys buy anything?

534
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,933
Not yet. Not yet. Buy some more.

535
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:53,266
a pug

536
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,366
Haha, bring the money into the group.

537
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,766
Look at this. It's all there.

538
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,366
And then?

539
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:10,333
And then it's vase gesticulation, gesticulation, gesticulation, gesticulation.

540
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,366
Is there any kind of formality to it?

541
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,766
The format is one for each of the six of us

542
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,200
I got the vase, too.

543
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,300
Then we'll all divide the flowers.

544
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,133
I've kept it for a day or two or three after I split it.

545
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,766
Uh, he's gonna open it up a little bit.

546
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,900
When it opens, use these petals.

547
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,266
or

548
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:30,566
I've seen them embossed by just taking this bloom.

549
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,366
Cut out the flowers.

550
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,700
And then just press him like this.

551
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,933
It's going to be one of those flat

552
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,400
And then the flower that unfolded

553
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,766
And then it can be done in the kind of postcard

554
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:40,300
The kind of postcard greeting cards I buy

555
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,700
And that one, including what's the name of that one.

556
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,466
That acrylic double glazing

557
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,200
And then it's like one of those picture frames.

558
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,133
You can give it to someone else.

559
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,933
And then some leaves and stuff.

560
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:50,800
And then it was like.

561
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,200
Don't you have that outdoor program?

562
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
We can then pick up some leaves

563
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
And then just put it together like a picture.

564
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,566
Yes and then bookmarks too

565
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:59,000
And then we'll all just make our own.

566
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
And then the last day.

567
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,900
Because I want this form

568
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,366
Just invite all your best friends and stuff.

569
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,133
You can make your own. You can raise your own.

570
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,066
And then it would be nice to hand them out to everyone.

571
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,766
And it's more in line with the seven-day cycle.

572
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,466
Then I thought I'd wake him up first.

573
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,666
Yeah, you can.

574
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,733
I'm sure I'll wake him up today.

575
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,266
Next in line

576
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:24,900
Who's next?

577
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,766
I'll do this next.

578
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:34,866
Who's next?

579
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,800
The next Lulua student.

580
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm here for the game.

581
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,466
It's actually my idea.

582
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:44,133
It's also about DIY.

583
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,933
For me I just I thought at first that it was possible to

584
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,066
Because it's World Earth Day.

585
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,533
So I thought I'd just do something a little more eco-friendly.

586
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,866
I don't know if you've ever done a jellyfish light.

587
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,133
It's just been a couple years since it's been on the scene.

588
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,066
Uh, it's a little light that looks like a jellyfish.

589
00:29:58,266 --> 00:29:58,700
right

590
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,166
And then this thing it originally came with a kit.

591
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,133
That is, you can just buy the kit online and do it

592
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,400
But that's what I'm thinking.

593
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,300
That is, since it's World Earth Day.

594
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,366
I've brushed up on a tutorial before

595
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:10,500
You can use the lid of that tea cup.

596
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,200
Then use it as a subject

597
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Then it's time to add some more ribbon

598
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,333
Or beads or something.

599
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,500
Uh, I didn't know we had one here.

600
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,766
No hot glue gun

601
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:18,566
If not.

602
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,066
We'll see if there's an alternative.

603
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,333
Or maybe it's okay to buy one.

604
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:22,866
And then it's all together.

605
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:25,066
Just about everyone makes one of these little lamps

606
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,700
It's just that he's kinda good looking.

607
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,466
And then this is one of the scenarios

608
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,400
There's another one that's also a little bit of this

609
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,900
How can I put it?

610
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,266
Low-carbon and recycled

611
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,600
That is, has anyone ever made a cardboard puppy

612
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,933
The one that was so hot the other day.

613
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:41,933
Yeah, and then you can put it on the doorstep.

614
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:43,933
And then the good thing about cardboard puppies is

615
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,566
If you want to do it very simply

616
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:46,866
Just take a cardboard box and cut it up.

617
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,066
Then just draw a little dog head and stick it on.

618
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,333
If you want to get a little more complicated

619
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,533
There are just a few.

620
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,366
It's just that if it's complicated, you'll need to cut more than one.

621
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:55,366
And then make a big

622
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,000
I've seen someone do a Doberman before.

623
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,266
But I've never done that.

624
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,900
Just but just read the tutorial

625
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,966
Seems pretty easy too.

626
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,300
It's easy to cut out just by drawing the cardstock

627
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:04,266
This I think.

628
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,500
So I think this is a good idea for

629
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
I was thinking the same thing.

630
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,600
There's gonna be a lot of cardboard boxes around here.

631
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,433
If that's all it takes
