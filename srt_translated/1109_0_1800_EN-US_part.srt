1
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,900
And then a shaker.

2
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,800
Time-stamped.

3
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,200
Poke at it.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,266
Poke a little. Poke a little each.

5
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,133
Wrap it around and poke it.

6
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,100
Hey can see

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
(of an unmarried couple) be close

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,933
boot up (computer)

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
That's what we'll be discussing today.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,800
mornings

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Let's talk about what we're gonna do on our last day.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,133
And then maybe

13
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,000
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,733
That's four more of these USBs over here.

15
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,066
It's possible that what's this? What's this?

16
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:10,866
This hard drive.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,066
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,966
In the morning I think the main discussion was

19
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,800
And then there's nothing else to do while the discussion is going on

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,466
If people are in deep thought

21
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,266
It's an embarrassment.

22
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,766
You can give this a go.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,166
Now that's embarrassing.

24
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,466
No, no, no.

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,300
Let's take it apart and see what it is.

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,800
Wow.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Only four?

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
For only four.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
No, it's fine.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,366
You've taken this apart for me, right? I'll do it.

31
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,900
Because you're right.

32
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,066
Haha I've already installed this thing

33
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,933
If you need a rechargeable battery, you can get it here. Thank you.

34
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:02,966
fastener

35
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,000
It's out.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,766
What can we do?

37
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,700
Keep the box.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,566
Well, this thing inside can be thrown away.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,966
this category of ingredients

40
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,133
It hasn't flowed in the last two years.

41
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:24,866
Then 1% first.

42
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,066
This one's for when everyone's in deep thought.

43
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,800
I can tell you about this one.

44
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,166
What is this thing?

45
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,933
In fact, you can look at this place

46
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:39,766
interjection of surprise

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,333
That's you looking at my workshop.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,300
Are we breaking and entering?

49
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:58,766
workplace

50
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:02,600
And there are six computers in this place, right?

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,133
Uh, and then 77.

52
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,766
Eight. - Uh-huh.

53
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,066
Recording will be this computer.

54
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,333
Each computer corresponds to one of your eyes.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,166
One eyeglass.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,133
And then this every computer I have every time you guys uh

57
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:16,933
End of recording.

58
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,900
Every three hours.

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,933
And then it's gonna be, uh-

60
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,366
That's where it's dumped into this hard drive.

61
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,200
And then this hard drive

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,700
It's the hard drive you'll be installing later.

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,133
Let's say it's this.

64
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,566
This L1, this L1.

65
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:28,500
This L2, this

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,000
All the names are written here.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
All right, here's your data in this.

68
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,000
It's our second life.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,066
Haha Second Life is in this one

70
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,933
Uh, let's say I'm an L1, right?

71
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,400
And then when you're done.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,166
That's what's gonna stick this eye up here.

73
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,300
And in the meantime, I've been following this.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,100
The first hard drive.

75
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,533
Yeah, and then this hard drive, it's got two cables.

76
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,300
One for the computer.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,466
One for the power supply.

78
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,333
And then this power supply

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,700
It's for this hard drive to pretend it's on the computer.

80
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,466
So what this box means is that

81
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,500
He gives a simulation of a computer environment

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
cheat sb again

83
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,966
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the hard drive knows it's got to work.

84
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,700
Uh and then this line ah this line

85
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,533
We've had some fun wiring it up.

86
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,600
Growing up like this is a hanging

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,100
What happens if the power goes out suddenly?

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,900
It's not good to say that a sudden computer blackout is going to

89
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,866
There's no such thing as a USB.

90
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,266
It's one of those backup power supplies.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
desirable

92
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,733
Beijing Providence

93
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,066
(express) thanks

94
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,000
we

95
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,133
Can we just talk and pretend?

96
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,533
Yeah, or maybe you guys should bring it first.

97
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,700
What did you bring?

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,400
You brought it.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,266
You'd better put on your glasses.

100
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,200
These glasses.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, it doesn't cover it.

102
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,366
I don't think it's even covered.

103
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,533
It's not covered now.

104
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,333
He's got a hole right here.

105
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,000
And then this place is going to be packed in here

106
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,366
So that's how you want it to be aligned.

107
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,900
Then slowly push it in.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,266
Let's see how it goes.

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,500
It's a little lighter.

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,933
That student told me the other day that it's quite fragile.

111
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,000
How do you do that?

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,333
It's okay.

113
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,900
Isn't there an opening here?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,366
It's the opposite of this one.

115
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,733
You just put them like this against

116
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,333
Then we'll see how it goes.

117
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,800
Push that in your hand.

118
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,966
He's still a little tight here if you put a little pressure on him.

119
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,166
But don't break it if you try too hard.

120
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,400
It's like you're so fragile.

121
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,266
But I don't really know much about this

122
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,766
There's a lot of screws to be screwed.

123
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,766
Yeah, where's the screw?

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,866
In there.

125
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,733
Oh, I see.

126
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:03,733
easy

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,266
And then just put it in.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,333
Uh-huh.

129
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,966
And then we're gonna put it in this box.

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,133
It's just that you'd better take this place off

131
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,200
And then this movie can be discarded.

132
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,933
Because we're going to use it for screws later.

133
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,966
Is it just four screws?

134
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,000
Uh, eight.

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,533
Eight? - Yeah.

136
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,466
yea

137
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:31,166
That's you. You pull out that strip.

138
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,500
Yeah, and then you see that hole?

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,566
The long one.

140
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:35,933
He's got a screw hole in there.

141
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,200
You're gonna have to put that on, too.

142
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,933
That's the screw hole for the big screw.

143
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,133
Ah which one?

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,566
Uh, I've got one screw up here.

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,533
That's it.

146
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,466
This thing.

147
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,800
Well, how about I point you in the right direction?

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Hey, you're on the right track.

149
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:53,733
Uh-huh.

150
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,866
And then every one of them over here.
